      <h2>Front Matter</h2>
      <p>It won't be intentional, but this space will probably gain the most content on this site. I am a product of strict religion, and was mentally shaped through both nature and nurture, for many decades, in how I was supposed to think and act, and what my posture was supposed to be towards the world. Shedding those layers alternates somewhere between difficult and impossible, most of the time. 
        <br />
        <br />
        So, yes, I have some thoughts.
        <br />

        <br />
        I've dabbled off and on with blogging over the years, but this is the first time I have real control over the entire site, how it's laid out, and what I want here, so I'm not stuck with simple blog posts of where I'm at, posted in reverse chronological order. This space is much more like a "digital garden" that I can tend with flexibility and freedom, letting it grow over time into whatever it becomes.
        <br />
        <br />
        That said, this will eventually be a link to some thoughts on religion. Don't take it too seriously. None of it matters nearly as much as I once believed.

        <p>Sometimes the world seems broken, fractured, separated from itselfâ€¦.in conflict. Philosophers and storytellers find ways to understand it. Religions operate in parallel, striving for resolution, often with incredible symmetries to each other. To varying degrees and in various ways, each person discovers little bits of harmony amongst the discordant sounds, glimpsing simple moments on our individual journeys home. If you know that feeling at all, you might appreciate this guy. He's hit some notes on a beautiful chord, seems to me.</p>
