    <p>Seriously though, you've found Lake Bottom Base, the homeliest homesite on the interwebs. The mud. This is my space to tinker, to learn about building websites, and to explore some of my own creativity in an ever evolving digital garden. I've dabbled off and on with blogging over the years, but it's never quite felt right. This time I have full control of the site - what is here, how it's laid out, etc., so I'm not stuck with simple blog posts only. Instead of a finished product, I view this as a living space that I can tend with flexibility and freedom, letting it grow over time into whatever it becomes. Primary navigation is in the upper right, where you'll find the major section headings. 'Bio' is about me, 'Thots' is what I'm thinking about, and 'Exp' is what I'm doing. That's it. Now, go back to your InstaSnapBook and leave me to my puttering.</p>
