    <p>This is Lake Bottom Base, the homliest homesite on the interwebs. Seriously. Go back to your InstaSnapBook and leave me to my puttering. I'll eventually add more background art and a page about this artist, a favorite of mine, now that Father Time has placed these works in the public domain. Thank you for visiting my website. Have a great day!</p>
