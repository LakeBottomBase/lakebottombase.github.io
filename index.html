      <h2><a href="https://youtu.be/7gUh8j5ui0o?si=M-Ypt4Zv1C26AKwW">The Art of Life, on YouTube</a></h2>
      <p>Sometimes the world seems broken, fractured, separated from itselfâ€¦.in conflict. Philosophers and storytellers find ways to understand it. Religions operate in parallel, striving for resolution, often with incredible symmetries to each other. To varying degrees and in various ways, each person discovers little bits of harmony amongst the discordant sounds, glimpsing simple moments on our individual journeys home. If you know that feeling at all, you might appreciate this guy. He's hit some notes on a beautiful chord, seems to me.</p>

    <!-- Add more articles as needed -->
    <p>I'll eventually add more background art and a page about this artist, a favorite of mine, now that Father Time has placed these works in the public domain. Thank you for visiting my website. Have a great day!</p>
